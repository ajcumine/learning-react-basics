# Learning Facebook React

The project was made following the [tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) on the Facebook React [website](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) and using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to learn the basics of React.

### How to use

Clone repository then carry out the following commands in your terminal:

```
